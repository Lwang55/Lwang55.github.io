            <h3>Good Website: <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/main?utm_source=web&utm_medium=landingpage&utm_campaign=logo" target="_blank">ZenlessZoneZero</a></h3>
            <p>Brightly colored website that expertly utilizes simple shapes and contrast to present a lot of information while avoiding visual clutter. Inspite of the numerous images,
                it doesnt become an issue because of how expertly they are aligned with the surrounding elements.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast: </strong>Contrast is executed well in this example. Inspite of the bright yellow, the grey of the fonts
                balances it and maintains an easy level of visibility. The text is bold and large, helping it standout amongst the visuals.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>Text and design elements remain consistent throughout the page. Several shapes and colors are consitently repeated throughout, giving the page a sense of unity. </li>
                <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>While not aligned following the traditional grid, things like the large bold numbers remaining consistently left aligned with the text. Each of the galleries line up with eachother along the vertical axis of the site.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>Each bold title relates to the subject next to it. Large photos of characters are presented in the form of a gallery, and kept from being confused with other elements.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Final Evaluation: </strong> ZenlessZoneZeroes page is an extremely well executed and visual appealing site. Carefully adhereing to CRAP principles while still standing out.</p>

            <h3>Bad Website: <a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/" target="_blank">Berkshire Hathaway</a></h3>
            <p>Extremely stripped down website, presenting only the absolute minimum information necessary. Consisting of a plain white background and rows of hyperlinks, a small geico advertisement is found centered at 
                the bottom.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast: </strong>Contrast between various texts is subtle. One color and font is maintained but the choice of color worsens in contrast to the white background. Excessive underlining and no other form of emphasis.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>Each section is consistently the same color and font. This oddly creates what could be called a consistent identity.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>The hyperlinks are aligned with eachother on both the y and x axis. The header and advertisement align along the center.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>While the links themselves are together, the actual link content has little to do with eachother, making it appear as though they have just been haphazardly thrown together.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Final Evaluation: While the website is not the worst of offenders, given its stripped nature means it still roughly follows alignment and repition. Its haphazard link listing, and poor contrast between link subjects, make it a visually unappealing and somewhat confusing website to actually use.</strong></p>
