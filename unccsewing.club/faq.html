            <button class="collapsible" data-collapsible-tab>I'm a graduate student, can I still join?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Absolutely! There is no such thing as an age on sewing or cosplay, as long as you are a student at UNCC you are welcome to join!</p>

            <button class="collapsible" data-collapsible-tab>I missed elections, is there still a way to get involved?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Of course! Whenever we host events, feel free to reach out to leadership. Going beyond, club member volunteering and input is always welcome. </p>

            <button class="collapsible" data-collapsible-tab>I've graduated, do I have to leave the club now?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>No! (unless the school tells us otherwise) Once a member always a member, while you may not be eligible for our school backed trips like Katsu con, you are 
                    still welcome to stay and hangout. You will just be given the "alumni" role to mark that you are no longer enrolled.

            <button class="collapsible" data-collapsible-tab>Do I have to know how to sew to join?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Absolutely not. We welcome members of all variety of skills and experience, and our community is always more than happy to help you out if you need advice. We also host sewing workshops and other crafting workshops open to all UNCC students.

            <button class="collapsible" data-collapsible-tab> Do I have to attend regular meetings?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Nope! While we do host regular meetings to update the org and hang out, attendance is not mandatory. Your presence in our discord and community is more than enough! Although if you intend to become a 
                    member of leadership, you will be expected to attend weekly meetings to discuss club operations.
