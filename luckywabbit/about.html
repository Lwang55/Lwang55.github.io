        <div class="about">
            <p>Founded by Willy "Muncher" Walcott in 34, Lucky Wabbit began its journey as a small town bakery, in a town that happened to be surrounded by carrots. Seeing an oppurtunity to bring some enjoyment to an otherwise plain vegetable,
                Willy began to experiment with various recipes, substituting carrots where he could. Eventually the world famous Carrot cake made of only carrots was born, and the Lucky Wabbit's bakery as you know it was born.  </p>
